# Deep fake detection Django Application
We highly recommend working without Docker, unless you enjoy digital claustrophobia and have a PhD in 'Container Escape Artistry' from the University of Masochistic Computing.
## Requirements:

**Note :** Nvidia GPU is mandatory to run the application.

- CUDA version >= 10.0 for GPU
- GPU Compute Capability > 3.0

You can find the list of requirements in [requirements.txt](https:/lukiod/SIH2024-Team22-404BrainNotFound/github.com//blob/master/Django%20Application/requirements.txt). Main requirements are listed below:

```
Python >= v3.6
Django >= v3.0
```

## Directory Structure

- ml_app -> Directory containing code in views.py file
- project_settings -> Contains Django settings and files to run in production
- static -> Contains all css, js and json files (for face-api)
- templates -> Template files for HTML

`<b>`Note:`</b>` Before running the project make sure you have created directories namely `<strong>`models, uploaded_images, uploaded_videos`</strong>` in the project root and that you have proper permissions to access them.

# Running application on Docker

#### Step 1: Install docker desktop and start the Docker daemon

#### Step 2: Run the deepfake detection docker docker image

```
docker run --rm --gpus all -v static_volume:/home/app/staticfiles/ -v media_volume:/app/uploaded_videos/ --name=deepfakeapplication lukiod/deefake-detection-20framemodel
```

#### Step 3: Run the Ngnix reverse proxy server docker image

```
docker run -p 80:80 --volumes-from deepfakeapplication -v static_volume:/home/app/staticfiles/ -v media_volume:/app/uploaded_videos/ lukiod/deepfake-nginx-proxyserver
```

#### Step 4: All set now launch up your application at [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80)

### Step 5: Star‚≠ê this repo üòâ on `<a href="https://github.com/lukiod/SIH2024-Team22-404BrainNotFound" >`

# Running application locally on your machine

We Recommend Using Wsl or Linux As their might be some issue with some libs

## For Linux

### Prerequisite

1. Copy your trained model to the models folder.
   - You can download our trained models from the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UX8jXUXyEjhLLZ38tcgOwGsZ6XFSLDJ-?usp=sharing) or you can train your models using the steps mentioned in Model Creation directory.

#### Step 1 : Clone the repo and Navigate to Django Application

`git clone https://github.com/lukiod/SIH-2024.git`

#### Step 2: Create virtualenv (optional)

`python -m venv venv`

#### Step 3: Activate virtualenv (optional)

`venv\Scripts\activate`

#### Step 4: Install requirements

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Step 5: Copy Models

`Copy your trained model to the models folder i.e Django Application/models/`

## For Windows

### Prerequisite

#### Step 1: Clone the repo and Navigate to Django Application

`git clone https://github.com/lukiod/SIH2024-Team22-404BrainNotFound.git`

#### Step 2: Install WSl into  your System

`wsl --install` in your cmd

#### Step 3: Update and Upgrade your linux subsystem

`sudo apt update`
`sudo apt upgrade`

#### Step 4 Install python into your wsl

Typing `wsl` in front of a cmd prompt make your command run in wsl
Example if you are in VS Code type `wsl sudo apt install python3-pip`

#### Step 5: Install requirements

`wsl sudo apt install cmake`
`wsl sudo apt install dlib`
`wsl sudo apt install -y libgl1-mesa-glx libglib2.0-0`
`wsl sudo apt install -y libsm6 libxext6 libxrender-dev`
`wsl sudo apt install -y libgl1-mesa-glx libglib2.0-0 libsm6 libxrender1 libxext6`
`wsl pip install -r requirements.txt`

- You can download our trained models from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UX8jXUXyEjhLLZ38tcgOwGsZ6XFSLDJ-?usp=sharing)

**Note :** The model name must be in specified format only i.e *model_84_acc_10_frames_final_data.pt*. Make sure that no of frames must be mentioned after certain 3 underscores `_` , in the above example the model is for 10 frames.

### Step 6: Run project

`python manage.py runserver`
